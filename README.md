This repository demonstrates a common yet often overlooked error scenario in Python: handling custom exceptions raised by external functions or libraries.  The `bug.py` file shows a function that can throw a user defined exception and the solution to manage the error without crashing the program. The `bugSolution.py` file provides a corrected version.  This is crucial for robust error handling and preventing unexpected program termination.
